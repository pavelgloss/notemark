REMOVE ITEM:
 - what if user hover on Favicon of note, than an X (close/delete) appears to remove it?
 - like checking off something from a list.

 COPY LINK
 - for future updates. It will be handy.
 - I may also have a simpler way to solve it in the interface, than I had documented before in the pdf.
 

KEEP TIMER (AUTO REMOVE OLD LINKS)
- for future updates. It will be handy.
- A simpler way would be to allow the user to set how long they want to keep their links:
 e.g. If user set keep for 5 days (120 hours), get time based on when the note is added.
      Get time again when extention opens, If time is less than 120 hours (5day), auto remove note.
 
- Or auto remove Notes that havent been interacted with for xx days (based on the keep timer).
 e.g. Tidy your notes: Remove Notes that I havent used in [10] days.

SPONSORSHIP
- i have some thoughts but not fully formed yet.
