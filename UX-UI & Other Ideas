 A few ideas that I think are simpler way to solve it in the interface, than I had documented before in the pdf.
 
 
 REMOVE ITEM:
 - what if user hover favicon, and an X (close/delete) button appears, to remove item?
 - like checking off something from a list.

 -------------------------------------------
  

 GET LINK  - for future updates. It will be handy.
 - get link icon will be add next to favicon.


ADD CURRENT TABS TO NOTEMARK - for future updates. It will be handy.
- Add all current tabs to notemark (and close them).

 -------------------------------------------
 
KEEP TIMER (AUTO REMOVE OLD LINKS) - for future updates. It will be handy.
- A simpler way would be to allow the user to set how long they want to keep their links:
 e.g. If user set keep for 5 days (120 hours), get time based on when the note is added.
      Get time again when extention opens, If time is less than 120 hours (5day), auto remove note.
 
- Or auto remove Notes that havent been interacted with for xx days (based on the keep timer).
 e.g. Tidy your notes: Remove Notes that I havent used in [10] days.
