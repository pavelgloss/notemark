 A few ideas that I think are simpler way to solve it in the interface, than I had documented before in the pdf.
 
 
 REMOVE ITEM:
 - what if user hover favicon, and an X (close/delete) button appears, to remove item?
 - like checking off something from a list.

 -------------------------------------------
  

 COPY LINK  - for future updates. It will be handy.
   eg. Hover mouse on favicon for 1.5sec, slide out Get link button,
   while it push Page Title to left for extra space for button (2x width of favicon).


ADD CURRENT TABS TO NOTEMARK - for future updates. It will be handy.
- Add all current tabs to notemark (and close them).

KEEP TIMER (AUTO REMOVE OLD LINKS) - for future updates. It will be handy.
- A simpler way would be to allow the user to set how long they want to keep their links:
 e.g. If user set keep for 5 days (120 hours), get time based on when the note is added.
      Get time again when extention opens, If time is less than 120 hours (5day), auto remove note.
 
- Or auto remove Notes that havent been interacted with for xx days (based on the keep timer).
 e.g. Tidy your notes: Remove Notes that I havent used in [10] days.

SPONSORSHIP
- i have some thoughts but not fully formed yet.
